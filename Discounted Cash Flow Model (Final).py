#Step 3: Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) which will be the discount rate that we would use to discount projected future free cash flows back to today's value. WACC is often used as a discount rate because it encapsulates the risk associated with a specific company's operations, basically a rate to determine whether the company is worth investing into. In this we calculate the cost of equity using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), risk free rate + beta*(market return - risk free rate).

#Step 4: Calculating Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), which I use as the estimate growth rate of future cash flows over time. To me, CAGR is a good way to estimate future growth rates because it takes into account the compounding effect of returns over time. It provides a single number that represents the average annual growth rate of an investment over a specific period of time. There are however some limitations to using CAGR to project future cash flows because it assumes that the growth rate of an investment is constant over time, which may not be the case in reality. It also doesn't take into account the volatility of an investmentâ€™s returns, which can be significant in some cases. Use due diligence in these cases.

#Step 5: the DCF valuation function calculates the past free cash flows and projects the future free cash flows for a specified number of years before applying a discount rate to come to the present values. It uses the scraped financial data from the scrape_financial_data function in step 2. The future free cash flows for the projected number of years grow at the compounded annual growth rate calculated earlier. The CAGR is then adjusted to cascade for each iteration for the proceeding years (a company is unlikely to grow at a constant rate). Finally, it calculates the present value of each cash flow and sums them up to determine the fair value of the stock based on the shares outstanding.
